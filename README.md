# Mining-related-conflict-and-cooperation-in-Peru
These are maps in my master thesis "Mining Related Conflicts and Cooperations in Peru â€“ To build an event dataset". 

The mining industry is essential for the global economy. In the past 15 years, the number of reported conflicts related to the mining industry increased rapidly. In Peru, mining conflicts are mainly associated with water scarcity, pollution, past conflicts and distribution of mining revenue. To mitigate the increasing conflicts and avoid losses, more and more companies start to incorporate corporate social responsibility [CSR] into their operation. In my master thesis, I built an event dataset to monitor conflicts and cooperation and their geographical distribution from 2009 to 2019 to find out the main drivers of conflicts and the effects of cooperation. The event dataset is based on around 1400 news reported retrieved by a news monitoring tool. After cleaning the data, the event dataset contains 432 mining-related events from 2009 to 2019. According to the results of the analysis of the dataset, I find that copper mines have the most conflicts and cooperations, followed by gold, silver, and zinc mines. Open-pit mines have more than double of conflictive events than underground mines. In the spatial analysis, regions with high conflict are also regions with high cooperation levels, such as regions Arequipa and Cajamarca. This is similar to findings from the event dataset that cooperative actions in Peru are reactions to existing conflicts or past grievances instead of proactive actions. By com- paring the spatial distribution of events and other spatial data layers, I find that the denser the population is, the more conflictive a mine site was reported by the news; the more impoverished the local population around a mine site is, the less conflictive the mine site is. In addition, if a mine site is located at a higher altitude, the less conflictive it is.

Since I wrote my master thesis under the research group in the Institute of Science, Technology and Policy of Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH-Zurich) and I signed a non-disclosure agreement with the group, I can't circulate the results before they publish. Therefore, I can't upload the metadata, the event datatset I built. 

Below are explanations of some explanations of core variables.

- MES: Mining Event Scale [MES], which indicates the intensity and impact on an 11-level ordinal scale, ranging from -5 (most conflictive event) to +5 (most cooperative event). Value 0 is assigned to neutral events. 

- MES score: MES values for all events are summed up in each region or mine projects to capture both MES intensity and event frequencies. 

- Cooperation/Conflict score: similar to MES scores, MES values for all events are summed up in each region or mine projects, seperately for conflictive events and cooperative events.

- Drivers: these are drivers behind each event, to explain why did a cooperative/conflictive event happened?
